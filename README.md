This project is for the DCSWorld F18 Air Speed Indicator. The display being used is the Waveshare 1.85" LCD without tought screen. https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-LCD-1.85
I'm working on a replacement Bezel to cover the display and adapt it to the Open Hornet LIP frame. I'll add it to the project once its commpleted.

Requirements:

ESP Board: ESP32 by Expressif (tested with version 3.3.1) https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json

LVGL v8.3.11: Install: Arduino IDE → Library Manager → search LVGL → install.

I've included STL files I used to print a mounting base for the display and the Bezel.

Its important to set the IDE up for the LCD Display. I've included a screenshot of my settings.
